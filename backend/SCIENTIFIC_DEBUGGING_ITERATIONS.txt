Iteration (1):
    Observation: Initial Run shows error that No ParameterResolver for Jackson Object Mapper object parameter
    Hypothesis: The ObjectMapper object is passed as an parameter to the Test method and injected as an dependency by
                the @Autowired annotation. It is possible that this object is not available to the method as a bean.
    Prediction: The test should be passed but since the ObjectMapper object parameter is not resolved,
                it will show error.
    Experiment: Run the given test case
Iteration (2):
    Observation: Run fails due to the same error
    Hypothesis: To make the bean available to the Test Method, do following:
                    1. Add a config class which returns a bean of instantiated ObjectMapper
                    2. Using @ContextConfiguration annotation add the config class to the main
                       RestaurantAutoWiringTest class
                    3. The annotation should be added just before the RestaurantAutoWiringTest class
    Prediction: The test should be passed
    Experiment: Run the given test method
Iteration (3):
    Observation: Run fails due to the same error
    Hypothesis: The application is not able to lead the configuration class.
                To load the application properly, do following:
                    1. Add @SpringBootTest annotation just before the test class
                    2. Check the logs, if the config file is loaded correctly or not
    Prediction: The test should be passed
    Experiment: Run the given test method
Iteration (4):
    Observation: The test is passed without any errors and shows no error in logs.
